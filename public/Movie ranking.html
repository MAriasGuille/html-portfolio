<h3>1. Enter the Void - Gaspar Noé (2009)</h3>
<p>Enter the Void is one of my favorite movies because it´s a real bad trip. <br> 
The music, the photograpy, the colors, the story... Basically for me all it´s amazing.</p>
<h3>2. Pulp Fiction - Quentin Tarantino (1994)</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie, I think its so funny.<br>
I love the 3 stories, the jokes of le BigMac are so funny, I´m fan of the colors, the tipografy.</p>
<p>...And all my life I want be Mia Wallace</p>
<h3>3. Into the Wild - Sean Penn (2007)</h3>
<p>When I think in this movie remember the feels of the first time to watch this. The first time just wanna take my bag and go away like the protagonist.</p>
